# Web-Design-Challenge

Use HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP to create a web page that displays visualizations and the data that is used to create the visualizations.
<br>
<br>
Start at the index.html site 
<br/>
While each page conects to each other, this is the best way to start!!

### Website Details:

* A [landing page] containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * A navigation bar with a link to all other pages
  * Separate links to each visualizations page (can click on the picture).

* Four [visualization pages] each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for a bettwe view.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

* A ["Comparisons" page] that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    * The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

* A ["Data" page] that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table must be a bootstrap table component.
    * The data must come from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML, or converting it to HTML.
    * Pandas has a nifty method approprately called to_html that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe.
